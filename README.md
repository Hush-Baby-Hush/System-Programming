### Learning Goals

1. Interact with a POSIX operating system in C via system calls to create system applications ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
2. Implement and evaluate a dynamic memory allocator ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
3. Analyze and implement a virtual memory subsystem ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
4. Create system applications that manipulate processes and threads ([1](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
5. Evaluate how OS schedules processes and threads ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
6. Communicate and synchronize between threads and processes to create robust system applications ([1](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
7. Use synchronization to identify and fix potential deadlock and race conditions in concurrent programs ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
8. Manipulate filesystem structures (inodes etc.) ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
9. Design and create client and server programs to communicate across networks ([1](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
10. Understands and uses system security mechanisms to build secure programs ([1](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([2](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes)), ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
11. Can analyze how a specific security error (e.g. buffer overflow, file access control, page access control) impacts the Confidentiality, Integrity and/or availability of data or service. ([1](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
12. Can identify multiple development practices (e.g. design reviews, code reviews, testing) as important practices to build secure programs. ([6](http://cs.illinois.edu/prospective-students/undergraduates/undergraduate-learning-outcomes))
13. Can briefly describe well-known security case studies (e.g. network protocol implementation errors, CPU side channel attacks) and how they comprise the Confidentiality, Integrity and/or Availability of data or service.
